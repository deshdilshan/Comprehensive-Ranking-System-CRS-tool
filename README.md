Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS) tool: skilled immigrants (Express Entry)

This tool will help you calculate your Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS) score based on the answers you provide below. The CRS is a points-based system that we use to assess and score your profile and rank it in the Express Entry pool. It’s used to assess your:

skills
education
language ability
work experience
other factors

Use this tool if:
you have not filled out an Express Entry profile and you’d like to see what your Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS) score might be if you do, OR
you were invited to apply for permanent residence, and want to see if a change to your profile may affect your CRS score. You need to make sure that your CRS score is above the minimum points score of your round of invitations.
